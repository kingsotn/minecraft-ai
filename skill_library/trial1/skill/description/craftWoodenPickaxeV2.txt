    // The function crafts a wooden pickaxe by first ensuring the availability of a crafting table, oak planks, and sticks in the inventory. If the crafting table is missing, it crafts one. It then checks for oak planks and crafts them from oak logs if needed. Similarly, it ensures the presence of sticks and crafts them from oak planks if necessary.
