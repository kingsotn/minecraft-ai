async function mineWoodLog(bot) {
    // The function is about mining a wood log block. It searches for various types of wood logs such as oak, birch, spruce, etc. Once a wood log block is found within a certain distance, it mines that block. After mining, it checks the inventory to confirm the presence of the mined wood log. If successful, it notifies the successful mining; otherwise, it indicates a failure in mining the wood log.
